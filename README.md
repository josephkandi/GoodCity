# GoodCity (CodePath iOS Final Project)

### About the Organization
Crossroads Foundation is a Hong Kong based non-profit organisation. Our goal is to connect people in a broken world. As our name suggests, we try to be a crossroads: bringing together those in need and those who can help through providing donations to those in need and working with strategic partners. 

### About the App
The GoodCity app provides an easy way for people to donate items to those in need and for the Crossroads organization to review and approve items. The app also helps people that donate find drop-off locations and coordinate pickups while provides notifications through the whole process. 

The goal of the GoodCity program is to help more than 4000 families in HongKong with donated items each year, and to avoid over 1000 ton of landfill waste.
